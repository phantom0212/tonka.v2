The AVH Extended Categories Widgets gives you three widgets for displaying categories.

1. A top categories widget. Shows the top X categories. This requires WordPress 2.8 or higher.

1. A Category Group widget. Shows categories from a group which is associated with the post/page that the visitor is looking at. Categories can be added to a group. Multiple groups can be made and every post/page can be associated with a different group. This requires WordPress 2.8 or higher.

The replacement widget gives you the following customizable options:

* Title of the widget.

* Hide empty categories.
* Show categories hierarchical.

The Top Categories widget gives you the following customizable options:

* Title of the widget.
* How many categories to show.
* Display as List or Drop-down.
* Show number of posts (Count) after the category.
* Sort by ID, Name, Count, Slug.
* Sort ascending or descending.

The Category Group widget gives you the following customizable options:

1. Go to the Presentation/Appearance->Widgets page and drag the widget into the sidebar of your choice. Configuration of the widget is done like all other widgets.

== Support ==

= What about support? =
Support is done through WordPress.org

= Depth selection =
Starting with version 2.0 and WordPress 2.8 you can select how many levels deep you want to show your categories. This option only works when you select Show Hierarchy as well.

Here is how it works: Say you have 5 top level categories and each top level has a number of children. You could manually select all the Top Level categories you want to show but now you can do the following:
You select to display all categories, select to Show hierarchy and select how many levels you want to show, in this case Toplevel only.

= Multiple Category Groups =
The following is an explanation how assigning multiple groups to page/post works.

Lets say you have the following groups:
Free Time
Theater
Movie
Music

Setup several Category Group widgets and associated each widget with one or more groups.
Widget 1 has association with Free Time
Widget 2 has association with Theater, Movie and Music
Widget 3 has association with Theater, Movie and Music

Page has associations the groups Free Time and Theater
* Widget 1: Shows categories of the Free Time group
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Theater group.
* Widget 3: Not displayed

Page has associations the group Movie.
* Widget 1: Not displayed
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Movie group.
* Widget 3: Not displayed


Page has associations the groups Free Time, Movie and Music
* Widget 1: Shows categories of the Free Time group
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Movie or Music group.
* Widget 3: Shows categories of the Music or Movie group.
Whether Widget 2 shows Movie or Music depends on the creation order of groups. If Widget 2 shows Movie, Widget 3 will show Music but if Widget 2 shows Music, Widget 3 will show Movie.
